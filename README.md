## 💡 Project Inspiration

The idea for this project is inspired by YouTuber **BackSlash Flutter**, who created this Weather App using GetX and MVC Architecture.

To test and strengthen my own learning, I rebuilt this project almost entirely on my own, implementing it using MVVM Architecture along with the Provider State Management Solution.

This approach helped me gain deeper insights into architecture design, state management, and scalable Flutter app development.
